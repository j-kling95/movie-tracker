# Movie Tracker

This is a small movie tracker app to help me learn Vue.js. The app should offer a web UI that lets users search for movies, add them to a watch list and rate them after they watched them.

The website consists of 4 main pages: 
1. a homepage that introduces functionality of the app,
2. a list of all the movies added to the users profile
3. a list that contains all watched and rated movies
4. a watchlist that contains all unwatched/unrated movies




## Things I learned:
- How to set up a single file components in Vue.js
- How to declare reactive states in Vue.js
- Basic CSS, especially flexbox layouts
- How to parse json files for relevant data and render them in Vue components

## To-do
- add a search bar that allows to search for new movies to watch
- add functionality to rate movies and remove ratings (i.e. change status of movies between watched <--> unwatched)
- Integrate an API that:
  - adds relevant data such as movie posters etc.
  - allows to search for movies to be added to the watch list
